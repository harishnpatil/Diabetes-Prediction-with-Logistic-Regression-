Project Title: Logistic Regression: Predictive Analysis in Diabetes


File: logistic_regression(predictive_analysis_in_diabetes).ipynb

Description:

This notebook demonstrates the use of logistic regression for predictive analysis in diabetes diagnosis. The workflow includes:

Data preprocessing and exploration

Feature selection and scaling

Building a logistic regression model

Evaluating the model using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and ROC-AUC

Dataset:

Source: A CSV file (diabetes.csv) obtained from Kaggle.

Description: The dataset contains 768 observations with 8 features such as glucose levels, blood pressure, BMI, and age. The target variable indicates whether a patient has diabetes (1) or not (0).

Usage: This dataset is widely used for binary classification tasks in the healthcare domain.

Key Highlights:

Focuses on binary classification to predict diabetes occurrence.

Implements cross-validation to ensure robustness.

Includes visualizations for model performance and insights into the dataset.

Dependencies:

Python 3.x

Libraries: numpy, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn
