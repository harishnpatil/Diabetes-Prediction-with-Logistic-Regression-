# Project Title: Logistic Regression: Predictive Analysis in Diabetes



**File:** [`Predictive Diabetes Analysis.ipynb`](./Predictive_Diabetes_Analysis.ipynb)

#### Description:

This notebook demonstrates the use of logistic regression for predictive analysis in diabetes diagnosis. The workflow includes:

- Data preprocessing and exploration
- Feature selection and scaling
- logistic\_regression(predictive\_analysis\_in\_diabetes).ipynbBuilding a logistic regression model
- Evaluating the model using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and ROC-AUC

#### Dataset:

- **Source:** A CSV file (`diabetes.csv`) obtained from Kaggle.
- **Description:** The dataset contains 768 observations with 8 features such as glucose levels, blood pressure, BMI, and age. The target variable indicates whether a patient has diabetes (1) or not (0).
- **Usage:** This dataset is widely used for binary classification tasks in the healthcare domain.

#### Key Highlights:

- Focuses on binary classification to predict diabetes occurrence.
- Implements cross-validation to ensure robustness.
- Includes visualizations for model performance and insights into the dataset.

#### Dependencies:

- Python 3.x
- Libraries: `numpy`, `pandas`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, `scikit-learn`
